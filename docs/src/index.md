# Julia INLA Ecosystem

A Julia-native reimplementation of the latent Gaussian model / INLA
stack originally provided by [R-INLA](https://www.r-inla.org/). The
goal is not a line-by-line port but a composable, dispatch-based,
SciML-aligned alternative covering the mainstream R-INLA workflows
with native performance and genuine extensibility.

## Status

`v0.1.0-rc1`. Phase A through D of the [replan](https://github.com/HaavardHvarnes/INLA.jl/blob/main/plans/replan-2026-04.md)
have landed: the four `src/`-bearing packages
([`GMRFs.jl`](packages/gmrfs.md),
[`LatentGaussianModels.jl`](packages/lgm.md),
[`INLASPDE.jl`](packages/inlaspde.md),
[`INLASPDERasters.jl`](packages/inlaspderasters.md)) cover the
canonical R-INLA datasets — Scotland and Pennsylvania BYM2, Meuse
zinc SPDE, the synthetic Negative Binomial / Gamma / Generic /
Seasonal / Leroux / disconnected-Besag suite — within the testing
strategy's tolerances. `LGMTuring.jl` provides the NUTS bridge for
INLA-vs-MCMC triangulation.

## Installing

The packages are registered on a personal Julia registry at
[`haavardhvarnes/JuliaRegistry`](https://github.com/haavardhvarnes/JuliaRegistry).
From a fresh Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.Registry.add(RegistrySpec(url = "https://github.com/haavardhvarnes/JuliaRegistry"))
Pkg.Registry.add("General")  # idempotent if already added
Pkg.add("INLA")              # umbrella: GMRFs + LatentGaussianModels + INLASPDE
```

To install only one core package, substitute `"INLA"` for `"GMRFs"`,
`"LatentGaussianModels"`, `"INLASPDE"`, or `"INLASPDERasters"`.

Optional sub-packages (`LGMTuring.jl`, `LGMFormula.jl`,
`GMRFsPardiso.jl`) are **not** registered yet — install them by
`Pkg.develop`-ing this repo's subdir directly, e.g.

```julia
Pkg.develop(url = "https://github.com/haavardhvarnes/INLA.jl",
            subdir = "packages/LGMTuring.jl")
```

## How to read this site

- **[Getting started](getting-started.md)** — the smallest possible
  Poisson + spatial random effect fit, top to bottom.
- **[Coming from R-INLA → Migration guide](coming-from-r-inla.md)** —
  side-by-side reference: every R-INLA `family`, `f(model = ...)`,
  prior, integration strategy, and post-fit accessor mapped to its
  Julia constructor or accessor function. Open this next to your R
  script while translating.
- **[Coming from R-INLA → Formula DSL (`@lgm`)](lgmformula-tutorial.md)** —
  if your R-INLA workflow leans on the formula DSL, the `@lgm` macro
  in `LGMFormula.jl` provides a near-source-to-source migration
  path. Worked examples for Scotland BYM2 and beyond.
- **Vignettes** — five end-to-end walkthroughs:
  - [Scotland BYM2](vignettes/scotland-bym2.md) (areal Poisson with
    BYM2 spatial random effect),
  - [Tokyo rainfall](vignettes/tokyo-rainfall.md) (Bernoulli with a
    cyclic RW2 seasonal),
  - [Meuse zinc SPDE](vignettes/meuse-spde.md) (Gaussian on point-referenced
    data via the SPDE–Matérn link),
  - [CoxPH and Weibull survival](vignettes/coxph-weibull-survival.md)
    (right-censored time-to-event regression with the augmented
    piecewise-exponential and PH-Weibull pathways),
  - [Joint longitudinal + survival](vignettes/joint-longitudinal-survival.md)
    (Baghfalaki-style multi-likelihood model with `Copy`-shared
    subject random effect).
- **Packages** — per-package overviews, exported API, and required
  contracts for extending them.
- **[References](references.md)** — the canonical method papers and
  validation datasets we test against.

## Differences from R-INLA

A side-by-side surface map for every R-INLA construct currently
covered (likelihoods, components, priors, accessors, prediction,
sampling) lives in [Coming from R-INLA → Migration
guide](coming-from-r-inla.md). The full list of
default-parameter parity calls lives in
[`plans/defaults-parity.md`](https://github.com/HaavardHvarnes/INLA.jl/blob/main/plans/defaults-parity.md).
Highlights:

- **Single dispatch table.** Every latent component, likelihood,
  prior, and integration scheme is a struct + a handful of methods.
  Adding a new component is "subtype `AbstractLatentComponent` and
  implement five methods" — no formula-DSL gatekeeping.
- **`LogDensityProblems` seam.** The posterior is a
  `LogDensityProblems`-conformant object; downstream samplers
  (Turing, AdvancedHMC, custom) plug in without touching this
  package.
- **R-INLA-equivalent BYM2 scaling and PC priors** by default. Where
  we differ, the docstring says so.
- **No `f(...)` / `inla.formula` macro magic.** A formula sugar layer
  (`@lgm`) exists in `LGMFormula.jl` for users coming from R; the
  underlying constructor API is the source of truth.
