Sample `raster` at each vertex of `mesh` and return a length-`num_vertices`
vector of values.

# Arguments

- `raster::Raster` — a 2D raster with `X` and `Y` dimensions. The raster
  must be defined on regular, monotonically-ordered coordinates along
  both axes (ascending or descending — both are supported).
- `mesh::INLAMesh` — the SPDE mesh. Mesh vertex coordinates are assumed
  to be in the same CRS as `raster`. `INLAMesh` does not currently
  carry CRS metadata; pass `mesh_crs` to assert against
  `Rasters.crs(raster)` at the API boundary.

# Keywords

- `method = :bilinear` — one of `:bilinear` or `:nearest`. Bilinear
  interpolation reproduces affine raster fields exactly at mesh
  vertices. Nearest-neighbour is useful for categorical covariates.
- `outside = :error` — policy for vertices outside the raster extent:
  `:error` throws, `:missing` substitutes `missingval`.
- `missingval = NaN` — the sentinel inserted for outside-domain
  vertices when `outside = :missing`.
- `mesh_crs = nothing` — optional CRS assertion (ADR-041). When
  supplied, must equal `Rasters.crs(raster)` or an `ArgumentError`
  is raised. Default `nothing` preserves the v0.2.x "trust the
  caller" behaviour. Reprojection is out of scope; if the CRSs
  differ, pre-project one side before calling.

# Returns

`Vector{Float64}` of length `num_vertices(mesh)` with one extracted
value per vertex, ordered by vertex index.

# Notes

- For bilinear sampling, a vertex at the raster edge still has a
  well-defined value (the bracketing cell collapses to the edge).
- If the raster itself contains missing values and a bracketing cell
  has any missing corner, the returned value is `NaN` for that vertex
  under `:bilinear`, and `missingval` under `:nearest` if the nearest
  cell itself is missing.
